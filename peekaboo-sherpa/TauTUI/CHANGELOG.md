# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.2.2] - Unreleased
- Markdown code blocks now wrap styled content and fences to the render width instead of violating TUI viewport invariants while streaming.
- Image rendering now honors `maxHeightCells`, reducing width proportionally to preserve aspect ratio, and applies a bounded default height.
- Editor pastes are now inserted atomically without per-character autocomplete work, stale hidden paste payloads are discarded when markers or editor text change, and payloads containing `$` or backslashes expand literally on submit.
- Editor and Input now share one Unicode-preserving paste sanitizer that strips terminal control characters and normalizes tabs and line endings.
- Open autocomplete suggestions now refresh after cursor movement and text deletion instead of applying results computed for a stale cursor position.
- ProcessTerminal now preserves split UTF-8 scalars, CSI/Kitty key sequences, and bracketed-paste delimiters across arbitrary descriptor read boundaries without letting malformed UTF-8 prefixes stall subsequent input.
- Background styles now always finish with a reset instead of leaking their color into later terminal output.
- ANSI-aware wrapping now treats CRLF and CR as line endings, preserving line boundaries from cross-platform terminal output.
- ChatDemo no longer retains its view model through the editor submit callback and builds without Swift 6.4 capture warnings.
- Input scrolling now uses terminal columns so CJK, fullwidth, and emoji text cannot overflow the viewport.
- ProcessTerminal shutdown is now idempotent and no longer writes terminal-mode resets when the terminal was never started.
- TUI sessions no longer render after shutdown, reuse stale render state after restart, or leave old rows visible when content becomes empty.
- Partial TUI updates now clear removed trailing rows, including empty spacer rows, without leaving stale terminal content behind.
- Height-only terminal resizes now trigger a full redraw so the main-screen viewport stays aligned.
- Full and partial terminal redraws now enforce the same visible-width invariant before writing component output.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-07-15
- TruncatedText no longer emits a full three-dot ellipsis when the available width is 1 or 2, which had made the rendered line wider than the requested width; it now fills with as many dots as fit, matching the public `truncate` helper. Thanks @devYRPauli.
- Refresh the swift-system dependency pin from 1.7.2 to 1.7.4.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-10
- Autocomplete suggestions can now be constructed by external TauTUI clients. Thanks @dcartman.
- Autocomplete no longer inserts a duplicate `@` when completing attachment paths. Thanks @DivineDominion.
- Select-list descriptions now align consistently for selected and unselected rows. Thanks @DivineDominion.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-04-28
- Refresh SwiftPM dependency pins, including swift-displaywidth 0.1.0 and swift-system 1.6.4.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-01-18
- TUI now intercepts Ctrl+C by default (stop terminal + exit), with an override hook and tests.
- Sync pi-mono keyboard handling: enable Kitty keyboard protocol, parse CSI-u sequences, and keep `.raw` input events opt-in (debug-only).
- Input: add common readline-style shortcuts (Ctrl+A/E/U/K/W) plus word navigation/deletion; ignore raw escape sequences.
- Editor: Ctrl+W word deletion now matches whitespace/punctuation run semantics; file-path pastes auto-prepend a safety space when needed.
- Editor: prompt history navigation (Up/Down), public cursor/lines accessors, and grapheme + display-width aware wrapping/cursor rendering; more tests.
- Add `Box`, `SettingsList`, and `Image` components (pi-mono parity) with tests.
- Add terminal image support (`TerminalImage`) for kitty + iTerm2, including image dimension sniffers (png/jpeg/gif/webp).
- Markdown: render tables width-aware (top/bottom borders, aligned columns, wrapped cell content) and style inline code like pi-mono; more tests.
- TUI: query terminal cell pixel size (CSI `16t`) and handle responses via `.terminalCellSize` input events.
- TUI: partial diff renderer clears each line (CSI `2K`) and clears trailing old lines; image escape lines skip width preconditions.
- Rendering math: `Ansi.stripCodes` ignores kitty/iTerm2 image escape sequences so `VisibleWidth` stays correct.

## [0.1.4] - 2025-11-21
- Added golden snapshots for TTYSampler scenarios (select, markdown, markdown tables) under `Tests/Fixtures/TTY`, with tests that replay scripts for visual regressions.
- TTYSampler gains `markdownTable` scenario and bundled scripts (`markdown.json`, `markdown-table.json`) for wrapping/table coverage.

## [0.1.3] - 2025-11-21
- Extend TTY replayer: `theme` events, space key token, and deterministic `renderNow` driven resize coverage; new tests cover theme flips and editor resize handling.
- TTYSampler CLI gains `select` and `markdown` scenarios plus bundled `select.json`; sample script now toggles dark theme.
- Sync/plan/docs updated to point at the TTY harness for upstream parity debugging.

## [0.1.2] - 2025-11-21
- Add global theming: `ThemePalette` dark/light presets, `apply(theme:)` on TUI/components, ChatDemo `/theme` toggle, KeyTester uses light theme.
- ANSI-aware wrapping/background helper shared across Text/Markdown; new `TruncatedText` aligns truncation/padding with pi-tui.
- Input parity: buffers bracketed paste markers and strips newlines before insert.
- Added tests for wrapping, truncation, theme propagation; docs/spec/sync notes updated.

## [0.1.1] - 2025-11-17
- Allow printable Unicode in editor paste path (drops only control characters) to match upstream pi-tui Unicode input behavior.
- Add Unicode-focused editor tests (emoji, umlauts, cursor movement, control-char stripping).
- Document printable Unicode handling and Alt+Enter newline guidance in spec/README.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-11-15
- Initial TauTUI sync with pi-tui core features (editor, autocomplete, markdown, loader, select list, renderer).
