# peekaboo daemon

Manage the on-demand headless daemon that keeps Peekaboo state warm, tracks windows live, and serves bridge requests.

The default listener is `~/Library/Application Support/Peekaboo/daemon.sock`, separate from Peekaboo.app's
`bridge.sock`.

After upgrading from a version that used `bridge.sock` for the daemon, default `status`, `start`, and `stop`
commands detect that legacy daemon by its daemon status. Peekaboo.app is never treated as a daemon.

Normal automation commands migrate legacy auto or manual daemons that advertise atomic conditional stop. The daemon
keeps its prior lifecycle mode, poll interval, and auto idle timeout, so a manually started daemon remains manual after
migration. MCP sessions remain process-owned and are never migrated.
When `bridge.sock` belongs to a healthy Peekaboo.app GUI host instead, normal commands keep using that app-held TCC
context and start the reusable daemon only if the app host is unavailable or lacks the required capability.
Automatic migration defers while operational requests are active and keeps using the legacy daemon for that invocation.
Older daemons without conditional stop remain on `bridge.sock` until they exit or are explicitly stopped. Explicit
`daemon start` asks the user to stop those older daemons first, and asks for a retry when supported daemons are busy.
If an incompatible daemon already owns `daemon.sock`, automation uses a build-scoped fallback. Default `status` reports
the compatible fallback and warns about the additional daemon; `start` promotes an idle, safely stoppable fallback from
auto to persistent manual mode on the same socket.

## Commands

### Start
```
peekaboo daemon start
```
Options:
- `--bridge-socket <path>` override the default daemon socket path.
- `--poll-interval <duration>` window tracker poll interval (default `1s`; bare values are milliseconds).
- `--wait <duration>` how long to wait for startup (default `3s`).

### Status
```
peekaboo daemon status
```
Shows:
- running state + PID
- bridge socket + host kind
- activity state (active requests, last activity, idle timeout/deadline)
- permissions (screen recording / accessibility / event synthesizing)
- snapshot cache summary
- window tracker stats (tracked windows, last event, polling)
- browser MCP state (connected, tool count, detected Chrome count)

### Stop
```
peekaboo daemon stop
```
Options:
- `--bridge-socket <path>` override the default daemon socket path.
- `--wait <duration>` how long to wait for shutdown (default `12s`, above the Bridge request deadline).

## Notes
- Normal automation commands auto-start the daemon in `auto` mode when the default daemon socket is unavailable.
- Auto-started daemons exit after an idle timeout (default 300 seconds), while explicit `peekaboo daemon start` remains manual and stays up until stopped.
- The daemon uses an in-memory snapshot store for speed.
- Set `PEEKABOO_DAEMON_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` to tune the auto-start idle timeout.
- Set `PEEKABOO_DAEMON_SOCKET` to override the auto-start daemon socket for testing.
- For local development with unsigned binaries, set `PEEKABOO_ALLOW_UNSIGNED_SOCKET_CLIENTS=1`.
