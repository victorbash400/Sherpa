# `peekaboo dialog`

`dialog` wraps `DialogService` so you can programmatically inspect, click, type into, dismiss, or drive file dialogs without re-running `see`. Target resolution and AX button presses stay in the background by default. Global keyboard/coordinate paths are never implicit: `input`, `file`, and `dismiss --force` require `--foreground`.

## Subcommands
| Name | Purpose | Key options |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `click` | Press a dialog button with AX. | `--button <exact label>` and an app/PID/window target are required; `--foreground` may focus first but never enables pointer fallback. |
| `input` | Enter text into a dialog field. | `--foreground` and `--text` are required; an app/PID/window target is optional and recommended. Optional `--field <label>` or `--index <0-based>` and `--clear`. |
| `file` | Drive NSOpenPanel/NSSavePanel style dialogs. | `--foreground` is required; an app/PID/window target is optional and recommended. Supports `--path <dir>`, `--name <filename>`, `--select <button>`, `--ensure-expanded`, and `--timeout <duration>`. Save-like actions verify the file exists and return `saved_path`. |
| `dismiss` | Close the current dialog. | Normal dismissal requires a target and uniquely resolves one cancel/close AXPress button in the background. `--force --foreground` explicitly sends global Escape. |
| `list` | Read dialog metadata (buttons, text fields, static text) without focusing or mutating it. | Optional `--app`/`--pid`, optional `--window-id`/`--window-title`/`--window-index`, and `--timeout <duration>`. |

## Implementation notes
- Every `dialog list` form is read-only/background and creates no mutation or snapshot debt. A targeted list must resolve exactly one dialog; ambiguity reports candidate window IDs.
- Default background click and non-forced dismiss use Bridge protocol 1.25's two-phase contract: a read-only prepare operation uniquely upgrades app/PID/title selectors to one exact process-generation/window receipt and retains the raw AX window, dialog, and button identities under a short-lived one-shot token.
- Immediately before AXPress, Peekaboo consumes the token, reacquires the exact-window write lane, re-enumerates and compares all three raw AX identities, and rechecks owner generation, window bounds, enabled state, and AXPress support. It never falls back to the physical pointer, clipboard, focus, or global input.
- Success is confirmed only after the retained dialog or sheet disappears. An accepted press without a verified postcondition is retry-unsafe and requires fresh observation; planning or identity ambiguity is a retry-safe pre-dispatch refusal.
- Remote targeted list/prepare/click/dismiss require the exact advertised and enabled operation, not merely a 1.25 version number. Missing capabilities refuse before operation transport.
- `dialog input`, `dialog file`, and forced dismissal use global keyboard or coordinate events and therefore reject calls without `--foreground` (or `foreground: true` over MCP).
- For compatibility with interactive foreground workflows, `dialog input` and `dialog file` may target the current dialog without an app/window selector. Receipt-pinned background click and non-forced dismiss never allow this targetless path.
- Button clicks and text entry route through `services.dialogs` helpers, which return dictionaries describing what happened; JSON output exposes those details verbatim (`button`, `field`, `text_length`, etc.).
- `dialog input` accepts either a field label (`--field`) or an index; when neither is provided it targets the first text field. `--clear` issues a Cmd+A/Delete before typing.
- `dialog file` can both navigate to a path and fill the filename field, then clicks the action button you specify (`--select Save`, `--select Open`, etc.). Leave `--path` blank to simply confirm the current directory.
- `dialog file` defaults to clicking the dialog’s `OKButton` when `--select` is omitted (or set to `default`). Prefer this when you don’t want to guess whether the button is labeled “Save”, “Open”, “Choose”, etc.
- `--ensure-expanded` expands the dialog (Show Details) before applying `--path`. If no `PathTextField` is present, Peekaboo falls back to the standard “Go to Folder…” shortcut to reliably land in the requested directory.
- For save-like actions (resolved by the actual clicked button title), `dialog file` verifies that the saved file appears on disk (5s timeout). On success it returns `saved_path` and `saved_path_verified=true`. If you provided `--path` + `--name`, Peekaboo also enforces that the file landed in the requested directory (symlinks like `/tmp` → `/private/tmp` are normalized).
- JSON output includes additional provenance for debugging without screenshots, including `dialog_identifier`, `found_via`, `button_identifier`, `saved_path_found_via`, and `path_navigation_method` (e.g. `path_textfield_typed+fallback_go_to_folder`).
- `dialog list` is invaluable before scripting a dialog: it prints button titles, placeholders, and static text so you can pick stable labels instead of guessing.

## Examples
```bash
# Click "Don't Save" on a TextEdit sheet
peekaboo dialog click --button "Don't Save" --app TextEdit

# Enter credentials into a password prompt
peekaboo dialog input --text hunter2 --field "Password" --clear --app Safari --foreground

# Choose a file in an open panel and confirm
peekaboo dialog file --path ~/Downloads --name report.pdf --select Open --foreground

# Save a file and verify the resulting path exists
peekaboo dialog file --path /tmp --name poem.rtf --select Save --app TextEdit --foreground --json

# Click the default action (OKButton) and include dialog provenance in JSON output
peekaboo dialog file --path ~/Downloads --name report.pdf --ensure-expanded --app TextEdit --foreground --json
```

## Troubleshooting
- Verify Screen Recording + Accessibility permissions (`peekaboo permissions status`).
- Confirm your process with `peekaboo app list`, its exact window with `peekaboo window list`, and current UI with `peekaboo see` before rerunning.
- Re-run with `--json` or `--verbose` to surface detailed errors.
