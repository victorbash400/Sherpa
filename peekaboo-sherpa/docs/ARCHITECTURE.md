```

- **PeekabooFoundation** – shared errors and low-level value types used across packages.
- **PeekabooProtocols** – cross-module protocols and transport-safe model contracts.
- **PeekabooExternalDependencies** – central package boundary for AXorcist, Swift Algorithms, Swift Log, Swift System, Commander, and Collections.
- **PeekabooAutomationKit** – owns capture, observation, input, application/menu/window services, snapshot management, and typed automation models.
- **PeekabooAutomation** – re-exports `PeekabooAutomationKit` and adds Peekaboo configuration, Tachikoma model resolution, and visualizer feedback adapters.
- **PeekabooBridge** – request/response transport and host/client plumbing for permission-bearing runtimes.
- **PeekabooVisualizer** – standalone visual feedback layer (`VisualizationClient`, event store, presets) used by automation and apps.
- **PeekabooUICore** – shared SwiftUI inspector and overlay components used by app surfaces.
- **PeekabooAgentRuntime** – MCP tools, ToolRegistry/formatters, and the agent service itself. Depends on `PeekabooAutomation` for services/data models and on `PeekabooVisualizer` for status tokens.
- **PeekabooCore** – thin umbrella (`_exported` imports + `PeekabooServices` convenience container). Apps/CLI keep importing `PeekabooCore`, but large features can now link the more focused products directly. Whoever instantiates `PeekabooServices` is responsible for calling `installAgentRuntimeDefaults()` so MCP tools and the ToolRegistry share that instance.
- **Tachikoma** – still the AI provider surface that the runtime modules call through. See
  [providers.md](providers.md) for the current provider and model catalog.

### Runtime hosting

Permission-bound automation can execute in three runtime shapes:

| Runtime | State and permissions | Transport |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reusable daemon | Warm snapshots, tracking, browser MCP state; daemon process TCC | `daemon.sock` Bridge protocol |
| Peekaboo.app | GUI-held TCC grants and app lifecycle | `bridge.sock` Bridge protocol |
| MCP server | Process-local services owned by the MCP client | stdio; no Bridge listener |

CLI automation resolves a healthy daemon first, then a capable Peekaboo.app host, then auto-starts the reusable daemon.
Operations that permit local fallback can run in the CLI process when no host is usable. Explicit socket and
`--no-remote` flags override this selection.

The daemon and GUI app never share a socket. Each Bridge listener holds an exclusive lease, publishes its socket
atomically, and removes only the filesystem object it owns. See [daemon.md](daemon.md) and
[bridge-host.md](bridge-host.md) for lifecycle, migration, security, and TCC troubleshooting.

### Dependency Flow

**Tachikoma** (AI Model Management)
- Provides `LanguageModel`, the `ModelProvider` protocol, provider parsers, and `Tachikoma.generateText`.
- `TachikomaConfiguration` supplies provider credentials and endpoint configuration.
- `PeekabooAIService` resolves configured model strings and calls Tachikoma with the selected `LanguageModel`.

**PeekabooAutomationKit**
- Exposes automation protocols and concrete implementations such as `ScreenCaptureService`, `UIAutomationService`, `MenuService`, and `ProcessService`.
- Owns capture, observation, input, window filtering, snapshot persistence, and their typed models.

**PeekabooAutomation**
- Re-exports `PeekabooAutomationKit` and adds `ConfigurationManager`, `PeekabooAIService`, and `VisualizerAutomationFeedbackClient`.
- Depends on Tachikoma for provider/model execution and on `PeekabooVisualizer` for optional UI feedback.

**PeekabooAgentRuntime**
- Imports `PeekabooAutomation` for services/models and hosts MCP/agent tooling (`PeekabooAgentService`, `MCPToolContext`, `ToolRegistry`, CLI/MCP formatters).
- Provides a clean `PeekabooServiceProviding` protocol so higher layers (CLI, macOS app, and the MCP server entrypoints) can swap concrete service collections without touching globals.

**PeekabooVisualizer**
- Stays decoupled from automation; only consumes `PeekabooProtocols` data (`DetectedElement`, `LogLevel`) so it can be embedded in other contexts later.
- `VisualizationClient` is still accessed via `PeekabooAutomation` convenience wrappers, but the module boundary keeps visual dependencies out of headless hosts.

## Tachikoma: AI Model Management

### Architecture Pattern: Explicit Model Selection

Peekaboo resolves configured provider strings into Tachikoma `LanguageModel` values before executing requests:

```swift
let ai = PeekabooAIService(configuration: .shared)
let model = ai.resolveConfiguredModel("openai/gpt-5.6")
let text = try await ai.generateText(prompt: "Describe this workflow", model: model)
```

### Key Components

#### LanguageModel
- **Role**: Typed model selection with provider identity and capability metadata.
- **Resolution**: `ProviderParser`, `AIProviderParser`, and `LanguageModel.parse(from:)` turn configuration strings into model values.

#### ModelProvider
- **Role**: Provider execution protocol used by Tachikoma and Peekaboo's custom compatible-provider adapter.
- **Supported Providers**: See [providers.md](providers.md) for the current provider reference.

#### TachikomaConfiguration
- **Role**: Provider keys, endpoints, and request configuration for Tachikoma calls.
- **Sources**: Peekaboo's `ConfigurationManager` loads `~/.peekaboo/config.json`, `~/.peekaboo/credentials`, and environment variables, then applies those values to Tachikoma.

## PeekabooCore: Automation Engine

### Architecture Pattern: Service Orchestration

PeekabooCore uses a service locator pattern with specialized service delegation:

```swift
let services = PeekabooServices()
let automation = services.automation  // UIAutomationService
let screenCapture = services.screenCapture  // ScreenCaptureService
let applications = services.applications  // ApplicationService
```

### Service Hierarchy

#### PeekabooServices (Service Locator)
- **Role**: Central registry for all automation services
- **Pattern**: Service locator with dependency injection support
- **Lifecycle**: Manages service initialization and coordination

##### Installing a services instance
`PeekabooServices` no longer registers itself globally. Whoever constructs an instance (CLI runtime, macOS app, integration test, etc.) **must** call `services.installAgentRuntimeDefaults()` immediately after initialization. This wires the container into `MCPToolContext` and `ToolRegistry` so downstream tooling (MCP server, CLI `peekaboo tools`, agent service) can resolve the exact same services without touching singletons. Skipping the install step will cause MCP and ToolRegistry code to fatal because no default factory is configured.

#### UIAutomationService (Orchestrator)
- **Role**: Primary automation interface delegating to specialized services
- **Delegation**: Routes operations to appropriate specialized services
- **Snapshot Management**: Maintains state across automation workflows

#### Specialized Services
Each service handles a specific aspect of automation:

- **ClickService**: Mouse interaction and element targeting
- **TypeService**: Keyboard input and text manipulation
- **ScreenCaptureService**: Display and window capture
- **ApplicationService**: Application discovery and management
- **WindowManagementService**: Window positioning and state control
- **MenuService**: Menu bar navigation and interaction
- **SnapshotManager**: State persistence and element caching

### Threading Model

**Main Thread Requirement**: All UI automation operations run on MainActor due to macOS requirements:

```swift
@MainActor
public final class UIAutomationService: UIAutomationServiceProtocol {
    // All operations are main-thread bound
}
```

### Integration Points

#### AI Integration
PeekabooCore integrates with Tachikoma through `PeekabooAgentService`:

```swift
let services = PeekabooServices()
services.installAgentRuntimeDefaults()
let ai = PeekabooAIService(configuration: services.configuration)
let model = ai.resolveConfiguredModel("anthropic/claude-opus-5") ?? .anthropic(.opus5)
let agent = try PeekabooAgentService(services: services, defaultModel: model)
```

#### Visual Feedback Integration
Services automatically connect to PeekabooVisualizer when available:

```swift
// Automatic visualizer integration
let visualizerClient = VisualizationClient.shared
_ = await visualizerClient.showClickFeedback(at: clickPoint, type: clickType)
```

Behind the scenes the client serializes a `VisualizerEvent` into `~/Library/Application Support/PeekabooShared/VisualizerEvents/<uuid>.json` and posts `boo.peekaboo.visualizer.event` via `NSDistributedNotificationCenter`. When Peekaboo.app is alive its `VisualizerEventReceiver` loads the payload and hands it to `VisualizerCoordinator`; otherwise the event is silently dropped and execution continues.

## Data Flow Architecture

### Automation Workflow

1. **Input**: Natural language task or direct API call
2. **AI Processing**: `PeekabooAgentService` uses Tachikoma models
3. **Service Orchestration**: `UIAutomationService` delegates to specialized services
4. **Platform Integration**: Services use macOS APIs (Accessibility, ScreenCaptureKit)
5. **Visual Feedback**: Operations trigger visualizer animations
6. **Snapshot Management**: State cached for subsequent operations

### Example Flow: "Click the Submit button"

```
User Input ("Click Submit")
    ↓
PeekabooAgentService (AI interpretation)
    ↓
UIAutomationService.detectElements() → ElementDetectionService
    ↓
UIAutomationService.click() → ClickService
    ↓
macOS Accessibility APIs
    ↓
VisualizationClient (click animation)
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Service Performance Ranges
- **Element Detection**: 200-800ms (AI analysis + accessibility correlation)
- **Click Operations**: 10-50ms (accessibility API optimization)
- **Screen Capture**: 20-100ms (ScreenCaptureKit acceleration)
- **Application Discovery**: 20-200ms (depending on system load)
- **Window Management**: 10-200ms (depending on operation complexity)

### Optimization Strategies
- **Snapshot Caching**: Element detection results cached per snapshot
- **Accessibility Timeouts**: Reduced from 6s to 2s to prevent hangs
- **Dual APIs**: Modern ScreenCaptureKit with CGWindowList fallback
- **Visual Feedback**: Async animations don't block automation operations

## Error Handling Strategy

### Layered Error Handling
1. **Service Level**: Individual services handle API-specific errors
2. **Orchestration Level**: UIAutomationService provides unified error handling
3. **Agent Level**: AI agent handles retry logic and error recovery
4. **Client Level**: Applications receive structured error information

### Defensive Programming
- **Permission Validation**: Automatic checks for Screen Recording and Accessibility permissions
- **Timeout Protection**: Configurable timeouts prevent system hangs
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback strategies for problematic applications
- **State Validation**: Element existence and accessibility verification

## Configuration Management

### Multi-Source Configuration
1. **Environment Variables**: `PEEKABOO_AI_PROVIDERS`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, etc.
2. **Credential Files**: `~/.peekaboo/config.json`, `~/.tachikoma/credentials`
3. **Runtime Parameters**: Method-level configuration overrides
4. **Feature Flags**: `PEEKABOO_USE_MODERN_CAPTURE`, etc.

### Configuration Precedence
```
CLI Arguments > Environment Variables > Credential Files > Config Files > Defaults
```

## Future Architecture Considerations

### Scalability
- Service architecture supports horizontal scaling through additional specialized services
- AI model provider supports multiple concurrent model instances
- Snapshot management designed for multi-user and multi-process scenarios

### Extensibility
- Plugin architecture possible through service locator pattern
- AI model provider supports custom model implementations
- Visual feedback system can be extended with additional visualization types

### Cross-Platform Potential
- Service interfaces abstract platform-specific implementations
- Threading model adaptable to other platforms
- AI integration remains platform-agnostic
