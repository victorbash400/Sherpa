# Local command benchmarks

Peekaboo keeps performance evidence local and explicit. Use the benchmark helper when you need repeatable
numbers for a command, especially after changing capture, observation, targeting, or input paths.

This is not telemetry. It does not install a background collector, write a global database, or send anything
over the network. It runs a command N times and writes JSON artifacts under `.artifacts/` so you can inspect or
share the specific run when needed.

Do not use this helper as a CI pass/fail gate. Use it for local before/after evidence and attach the summary only
when the numbers materially support a performance change.

## Quick start

Build a CLI once:

```bash
pnpm run build:cli
BIN="$(swift build --package-path Apps/CLI --show-bin-path)/peekaboo"
```

Use the same binary for before/after comparisons. Debug and release builds are not comparable; use
`pnpm run build:cli:release` and the release `peekaboo` path when you need release-build evidence.

Run a UI-free smoke benchmark:

```bash
pnpm run benchmark:tools \
  --name tools-json \
  --runs 5 \
  --warmups 1 \
  --bin "$BIN" \
  -- tools --json-output
```

The summary path is printed at the end:

```text
.artifacts/playground-tools/20260517T021530Z-tools-json-summary.json
```

## Playground fixture benchmarks

For UI commands, use the Playground fixture windows so each run targets the same app/window shape.

1. Build and open the Playground app.
2. Open the relevant fixture window from the Playground `Fixtures` menu.
3. Run the benchmark against the fixture title or a snapshot captured from that fixture.

Example `see` benchmark:

```bash
pnpm run benchmark:tools \
  --name see-click-fixture \
  --runs 10 \
  --warmups 1 \
  --bin "$BIN" \
  -- see --app boo.peekaboo.playground.debug --mode window --window-title "Click Fixture" --json-output
```

Example `menu` benchmark:

```bash
pnpm run benchmark:tools \
  --name menu-list-playground \
  --runs 5 \
  --warmups 1 \
  --bin "$BIN" \
  -- menu list --app boo.peekaboo.playground.debug --json-output
```

## How to read the summary

- `wall_time` measures total process/runtime time from the helper's perspective.
- `execution_time` uses the command's own JSON timing field when the command exposes one.
- Summaries include `mean_s`, `stddev_s`, `median_s`, `p95_s`, `min_s`, and `max_s`; `stddev_s` is `null` for
  a single measured sample.
- `warmup` runs are saved and printed but excluded from reported statistics and failure counts. Measured runs determine
  the helper's exit status.
- The default is 10 measured runs and 0 warmups to preserve the older helper behavior. Use 1-3 warmups when
  collecting PR evidence for a code path that benefits from daemon, filesystem, or process warmup.
- `failures` lists measured runs with non-zero exit codes.
- The helper exits non-zero when measured runs fail unless you pass `--allow-failures`.
- The summary includes the command arguments after replacing the current checkout path with `.` and `$HOME` with
  `~`; per-run payloads still contain the raw command output, so avoid benchmarking commands with secrets or
  sensitive local paths if you plan to share the artifacts.

Use p95 for regressions and PR evidence. Avoid hard thresholds in unit tests; command latency depends on host load,
permissions, active windows, display count, and whether the daemon/Bridge path is warm.

For cleaner macOS measurements, keep the machine awake (`caffeinate` is useful for longer runs), close heavy apps,
avoid Low Power Mode, and treat thermal throttling or Spotlight/indexing activity as reasons to rerun the sample.
