# Security & Tool Hardening

Peekaboo ships powerful automation tools (clicking, typing, shell, window management, etc.). You can now constrain what the agent and MCP server expose.

## How to disable tools

- **One-off via env (highest precedence for allow list)**  
  - `PEEKABOO_ALLOW_TOOLS="see,click"` – only these tools are exposed.  
  - `PEEKABOO_DISABLE_TOOLS="shell,menu_click"` – always removed, combined with config `deny`.
- **Persistent config (`~/.peekaboo/config.json`)**  
  ```jsonc
  {
    "tools": {
      "allow": ["see", "click", "type"],
      "deny": ["shell", "window"]
    }
  }
  ```
  Env `ALLOW` replaces the config allow list; env `DISABLE` is additive with config `deny`. Deny always wins when a tool appears in both lists. Names are case-insensitive; `kebab-case` or `snake_case` both work.
- **Disable AI entirely even if keys exist**  
  ```jsonc
  {
    "aiProviders": { "providers": "" },
    "tools": { "deny": ["image", "analyze", "agent"] }
  }
  ```
  Empty providers short-circuit every AI call, and the deny list keeps AI-only tools off the registry. Combine with `PEEKABOO_ALLOW_TOOLS`/`PEEKABOO_DISABLE_TOOLS` if you need per-run overrides.

Filters apply everywhere tools are surfaced: CLI `peekaboo tools`, the agent toolset, and the MCP server’s tool registry.

Agent execution adds a stricter runtime boundary. New Agent sessions are immutable background-only sessions unless the
human starts that session with `peekaboo agent ... --allow-foreground`. The saved value is an immutable maximum, not a
bearer credential: every resumed process invocation returns to background-only unless the human passes the flag again.
Provider-facing and MCP argument validation runs before execution authority is evaluated, so malformed calls remain
invalid requests instead of being mislabeled as policy refusals. The policy is then checked centrally before dispatch
and cannot be changed by model output or writable session JSON alone. Foreground authorization never exposes the Shell tool: normal Agent
toolsets omit `shell`, and the execution boundary refuses it under both Agent policies. Foreground UI authority is not
a process sandbox; a trusted prompt can operate terminal or scripting apps through their UI. Public MCP servers and
standalone MCP tool contexts are also background-only. Foreground-capable CLI wrappers require an explicit
`--foreground`, while `peekaboo mcp serve` never grants foreground authority. Background-only sessions refuse targetless/process-only raw `press`, persistent
clipboard writes, targetless dialog input, dialog file actions, browser setup/fronting, and Space switch/follow while
retaining exact prepared dialog actions, dialog/Space listing, and unfollowed window placement. Agent typing requires
an exact non-dialog snapshot/element. Agent paste admits
only direct text with a generation-pinned app/PID/window authorization and a canonical background result; targetless,
foreground, current-clipboard, and binary paste remain refused. Process-only delivery cannot prove that
the focused target is not modal UI.

## Desktop context injection (DESKTOP_STATE)

When the agent streaming loop runs with context injection enabled, Peekaboo gathers lightweight desktop state (focused app/window title, cursor position, and **clipboard preview only when the `clipboard` tool is enabled**) and injects it as two messages:

- A stable **policy** message (system): DESKTOP_STATE is **untrusted data**, never instructions.
- A **data** message (user): delimited with a per-injection nonce (`<DESKTOP_STATE …>`) and **datamarked** (every line prefixed with `DESKTOP_STATE | `) to reduce prompt-injection risk from window titles/clipboard contents.

If you disable the `clipboard` tool via allow/deny filters, the injected DESKTOP_STATE will not read or include clipboard content.

## Risk by tool category

- **Critical / high risk** – should usually be disabled in untrusted contexts  
  - `shell`: can run arbitrary commands. Normal Agent sessions omit and refuse it even with `--allow-foreground`; keep
    it disabled in any separately embedded or custom toolset unless you fully trust the caller and prompts.
  - `dialog_click`, `dialog_input`: can confirm destructive dialogs.
- **Requires AI network access** – these call out to the configured language/vision provider whenever used  
  - `image` (when passed `--analyze`/`question`) and MCP `image` tool.  
  - `analyze` (CLI/MCP) – always uploads the file to the active AI provider.  
  - `peekaboo agent …` / `MCPAgentTool` – the planning loop streams prompts/responses to GPT‑5.1 (or whichever model you configured).  
  - Any audio capture path (`AudioInputService`, voice command helpers) that transcribes speech through `PeekabooAIService`.  
  Disable by clearing `PEEKABOO_AI_PROVIDERS`, removing API keys, or adding these names to your deny list when running offline.
- **Medium risk** – can manipulate apps or data  
  - `capture`: records retained screen/window/region frames, contact sheets, metadata, and optional MP4 files. Disable it when MCP or agent clients should not persist screen contents.
  - `click`, `type`, and `paste`: can trigger actions in foreground apps or target a background app when a safe receipt is known. Background clicks use Accessibility; background typed delivery requires Event Synthesizing. Raw `press` requires either an exact window/focused-element receipt or explicit `--foreground` consent.
  - `scroll`: targeted background scrolling prefers Accessibility. A fresh exact-window pixel snapshot may use retry-unsafe PID-routed wheel delivery only for visible WebKit-linked, non-Electron apps; targetless, smooth, and delayed scrolling require explicit foreground mode and Event Synthesizing.
  - `drag`, `move`: manipulate the shared physical cursor, require explicit foreground consent, and need Event Synthesizing.
  - `window`, `app`, `menu_click`, `dock_launch`, `space`: can close apps, move windows, switch spaces.  
  - `permissions`: can prompt/alter macOS permissions flow; disable for locked-down sessions.  
  - `agent`: can cascade into other tools via MCP, but the nested invocation is always background-only and omits Shell.
- **Low risk / observational**  
  - `see`, `screenshot`, `list_apps`, `list_windows`, `list_screens`, `list_menus`: read-only discovery and capture.  
  - `image`, `analyze`, `sleep`, `done`, `need_info`: informational or control-plane only.

### Recommendations

- In production or shared machines: start with `PEEKABOO_ALLOW_TOOLS="see,click,type"` and add more only as required.  
- Document your chosen policy in team runbooks so other operators apply the same filters.
