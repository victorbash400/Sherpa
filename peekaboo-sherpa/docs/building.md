# Building Peekaboo

## Prerequisites

- macOS 15.0+
- Swift 6.2+ toolchain (Xcode 26.x or newer recommended)
- Node.js 22+ (Corepack-enabled) — only needed for pnpm helper scripts; core Swift builds do not require Node.
- pnpm (`corepack enable pnpm`)
- SwiftLint and SwiftFormat for the repository validation helpers (`brew install swiftlint swiftformat`)

See [platform-support.md](platform-support.md) for the support matrix across released binaries, apps,
Swift packages, source builds, and pnpm helper scripts.

## Common Builds

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/openclaw/Peekaboo.git
cd peekaboo

# Install JS deps
pnpm install

# Build everything (CLI + Swift support scripts)
pnpm run build:all

# Swift CLI only (debug)
pnpm run build:swift

# Release binary (universal)
pnpm run build:swift:all

# Standalone helper
./scripts/build-cli-standalone.sh [--install]
```

## Releases

For full release automation (tarballs, npm package, checksums), follow [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md). Quick recap:

```bash
# Validate + prep
pnpm run prepare-release

# Deterministic metadata/docs/CLI contract only (no registry or artifact checks)
pnpm run prepare-release -- --dry-run --bin Apps/CLI/.build/debug/peekaboo

# Generate artifacts / publish
./scripts/release-binaries.sh --create-github-release --publish-npm
```
