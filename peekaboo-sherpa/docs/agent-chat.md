# Minimal Agent Chat Mode

This document captures the initial design for a dependency-free interactive chat shell built on top of `peekaboo agent`. The goal is to let operators hold a live conversation—enter a prompt, let the agent act, then immediately enter another prompt—without reinventing the retired TermKit UI.

## How You Enter Chat Mode

- `peekaboo agent "<task>"` keeps the existing single-shot behavior.
- Running `peekaboo agent` **without** a task drops you into chat mode automatically when stdout is an interactive TTY.
- In non-interactive environments the command prints the chat help menu and exits, except a taskless
  `agent resume [session-id]`, which consumes piped prompts for the saved session.
- `agent chat` always forces the interactive loop (even when piped) and doubles as the discoverable/explicit mode for documentation and tooling.
  - If you pass an initial prompt after `agent chat`, that text becomes the first turn before the prompt reappears.

## Command Surface

- Expose chat as `peekaboo agent chat`.
- When present, the command enters an interactive loop instead of executing once and exiting.
- Shared execution options (`--model`, `--max-steps`, `--queue-mode`, etc.) still apply at launch; their values remain in effect for the entire chat session.

## Session Lifecycle

1. `agent resume <id>` resumes an explicit session, `agent resume` resumes the most recent session, and `agent chat` creates a fresh one.
2. The resolved session ID is reused for every turn so the agent maintains context.
3. Exiting the loop leaves the session in the cache so the standard `agent` command can resume it later.

## Control Flow

```text
peekaboo agent chat
→ print header (model, session ID, exit instructions)
loop {
    prompt with `chat> `
    read a line from stdin (skip empty lines)
    run the existing agent pipeline with that line as the task text
    display the usual transcript (enhanced/compact/minimal) until completion
}
```

- `readLine()` is sufficient for v1; pasted multi-line text will arrive line-by-line but still accumulate because each line triggers a run.
- When the loop opens it prints “Type /help for chat commands” and immediately dumps the `/help` menu so operators know what to expect.
- `/help` can be entered at any time to reprint the built-in menu.
- End-of-file (Ctrl+D) or a SIGINT while idle breaks out of the loop. Ctrl+C while a task is running cancels that turn and returns to the prompt.
- Press `Esc` during an active turn to cancel the in-flight run immediately and return to the prompt.

## Prompt & Output

- Display a simple ASCII prompt: `chat> `.
- After each turn, optionally print a one-line summary (model, duration, tool count) before reprinting the prompt. This avoids repeating the full banner every time.
- `Type /help …` banner plus the help menu are shown automatically the moment interactive mode starts, even before the first task (or immediately after the optional `agent chat` initial prompt).
- Reuse the existing output-mode machinery so enhanced/compact/minimal renderings continue to work automatically.

## Error Handling

- Failed executions (missing credentials, tool errors, etc.) bubble through the current `displayResult` / error printers so behavior matches the one-shot command. An automatic taskless piped resume exits nonzero after a failed turn; an explicit `agent chat` loop stays alive.
- If the agent reports a fatal error, the loop stays alive unless the error indicates initialization failure (e.g., no provider configured), in which case we exit immediately.

## Exit Semantics

- Ctrl+C while idle → exit the loop cleanly.
- Ctrl+C while running → cancel the active task and return to the prompt (press again to exit entirely if desired).
- Ctrl+D (EOF) → exit after the current prompt.
- Non-interactive `agent run` invocations without a task print the help text once and exit, except taskless session resumes,
  which read piped prompts and exit nonzero after a failed turn.

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for Minimal Version)

- Slash commands (`/model`, `/stats`, `/clear`).
- Multi-line paste blocks (triple quotes) or heredoc-style delimiters.
- Richer terminal UI (colors in the prompt, live tool streaming columns, etc.).
- Dedicated transcript panes or scrolling history.

The minimal design above provides a usable chat workflow immediately while keeping the implementation lean enough to land incrementally.
